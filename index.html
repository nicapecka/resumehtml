    <h1>Nica Felix Resume</h1>

    <p> Previously my career has always been in the Salon/Retail industry. In the interest of something more reliable I
        chose to enroll in Udemy's Web Development Course. Now as a Full Stack Devolper I am seeking a company
        interested in Developers with non-traditional backgrounds. </h2>
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>With my previous experience as a hairstylist and retail associate I have developed an expertise in communication,
        patience, and working independently. All very critical skills to have not only as a Developer but as a team
        member.</p>
